# Face Detection in JavaScript
Hi, I am adarsh Pandey . I am a software developer and a passionate learner. I love to learn and share my knowledge with
This project demonstrates face detection using JavaScript and modern web technologies. It leverages the power of machine learning models to detect faces in images or video streams.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using the webcam.
- Supports image-based face detection.
- Built with lightweight and efficient libraries.
- Easy to integrate into other projects.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the user interface.
- **Face-api.js**: A library for face detection and recognition.
- **WebRTC**: For accessing the webcam.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Face-Detection-JavaScript.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Face-Detection-JavaScript
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the application.

## Usage

1. Allow the browser to access your webcam.
2. The application will start detecting faces in real-time.
3. You can also upload an image for face detection.
